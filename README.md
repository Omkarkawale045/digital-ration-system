# digital-ration-system
# 📌 Overview

The Digital Ration Distribution System is a technology-driven solution designed to improve efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in government ration distribution. Built using Flutter, Firebase, and Firestore, the system allows beneficiaries to check ration details, view schedules, receive scheme updates, and submit complaints directly to government authorities. It resolves major issues in traditional systems such as fraud, overcrowding, mismanagement, and lack of awareness.

# 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional ration distribution faces challenges like corruption, duplicate ration cards, long queues, poor stock tracking, and limited user awareness of government schemes. The absence of real-time monitoring and scheduling leads to misallocation of resources, inconvenience, and mistrust among beneficiaries. A digital and automated system is needed to ensure equitable access and transparency.

# 📌 Motivation

Inefficiencies, fraud, and lack of accessibility in the current ration system motivated the development of a modern solution. Many users still face long waiting times, poor information access, and no proper grievance mechanism. A digital system can resolve these issues by improving transparency, reducing hardships, and ensuring benefits reach the rightful users.
